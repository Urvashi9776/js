## üìÅ Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories, each focusing on specific JavaScript concepts:

- **01_basics/**: Basic JavaScript concepts and syntax. 
  - Example: `test.js` - Basic script demonstrating fundamental principles.

- **02_basics/**: Intermediate concepts, including objects and object-oriented programming.
  - Example: `object2` - Demonstrates the use of objects in JavaScript.

- **03_basics/**: Introduces Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) and other advanced syntax.
  - Example: `iife` - Shows the implementation and benefits of IIFE.

- **Daa/**: Advanced algorithms, such as sorting algorithms.
  - Example: `Create insertion sort` - An implementation of the insertion sort algorithm.

- **advance_one/**: Covers advanced JavaScript features like Promises.
  - Example: `promise` - Demonstrates how to use Promises for asynchronous programming.

- **dom/**: Examples related to Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation.
  - Example: `dom` - Basic DOM manipulation techniques.

- **events/**: Handling events in JavaScript.
  - Example: `three` - Shows how to handle events in the browser.

- **flowcontrol/**: Control flow concepts, including loops and conditionals.
  - Example: `flow` - Demonstrates flow control mechanisms.

- **fun_with_js/**: Fun projects and experiments using JavaScript.
  - Example: `fun` - Various playful projects to explore JavaScript capabilities.

- **iterations/**: Concepts related to iterations and loops.
  - Example: `iteration` - Demonstrates different types of loops in JavaScript.

- **objectandoops/**: Object-oriented programming concepts in JavaScript.
  - Example: `oops` - Explores prototypes, inheritance, and other OOP principles.
